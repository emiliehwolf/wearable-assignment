# Instructions
### Step 1
Download and unzip the raw data somewhere onto your computer from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
### Step 2
Download and move the run_analysis.R file into the unzipped 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder
### Step 3
Open the R console and use setwd() to change the working directory to the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder
### Step 4
Source the run_analysis.R script and wait for the tidy data to be created



# run_analysis.R
This script does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Creative License
* I chose to keep the variable names as short as possible while still keeping them descriptive. You'll notice I removed parentheses, commas, and repeated words. I also shortened words such as "Gravity" to just "Grav". I decided to leave "tBody" and "fBody" alone rather than elongate them.
* When subsetting the columns concerning mean and standard deviation, I decided to include **any** column with "mean" or "std" in the name. Therefore, you'll notice several "FreqMean" and "GravMean" variables that are different from the rest. They seemed relevent to the assignment, so I kept them a part of the dataset.
* For more details on how this script works and the decisions I made, view the comments within the R code.



# run_analysis.R Output
When the script has completed successfully, there will be 2 objects and a newly created text file.
## 'tidy' object
This is the merged data with abbreviated (although descriptive) column names and 2 factored variables.

# The Raw Data
## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

### Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
